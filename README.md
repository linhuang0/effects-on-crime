# Assessing the associations between unemployment and cost of living on criminal activity and the general impact of covid-19 lockdowns on criminal activity : A district based analysis of Christchurch and Wellington



Introduction: Criminal activity has been widely reported on in the New Zealand media of late.
With no shortage of suggestions as to possible factors that may be influencing this apparent
spike in crime such as the return of the 501’s from Australia or the perception that law
enforcement has gone soft on crime in general. Nonetheless, research does appear to be
lacking somewhat in regards to both the factors of unemployment and cost of living and their
association with crime in a New Zealand district specific context. In addition, the emergence of
covid in recent years has also been postulated as impacting upon crime, yet evidence also
appears to be lacking somewhat in terms of its effect in a New Zealand setting.
Objectives: The aim of this study and subsequent analysis is to explore the associations
between unemployment, cost of living and covid lockdowns on crime in both Canterbury (which
includes the Christchurch metropolitan area plus Mid/South Canterbury) and Wellington (which
includes Upper and Lower Hutt) to see if any noticeable trends or differences arose when
comparing and contrasting the two districts.
Methods: Data was collected from online available sources such as the New Zealand Police
website and Stats Aotearoa. The data was then broken down into three specific subcategories of
crime being: 1) robbery; 2) theft of property and 3) unlawful entry with intent to commit
burglary. The initial analysis looks at whether a linear relationship exists between
unemployment and cost of living. This was achieved by constructing a correlation coefficient
and linear regression model for both factors. With further analysis done using both a time series
analysis and change point analysis to see if there does appear to be a noticeable difference in
terms of crime rates when looking at both the 2020 and 2021 lockdowns that occurred in New
Zealand due to covid.
Results: In our initial analysis (using both correlation and regression models) there appeared to
be no statistically significant relationship between either unemployment or the cost of living on
the three specific subcategories of crime. However, change point analysis clearly showed the
impact that covid-19 lockdowns had on the general crime rate in both 2020 and 2021. In
addition, the crime rate for all the subcategories of crime has followed similar trends in
Christchurch and Wellington.
Discussion and Conclusion: It was observed that neither unemployment or the cost of living
had an effect on the particular types of crime that was investigated in this study. Whether these
results are applicable in the context of other New Zealand urban areas such as Auckland or
Dunedin is somewhat questionable given how aspects such as city population do vary drastically
within New Zealand as well as the multitude of other factors that are also likely to be
influencing the individual’s capacity to commit crime. We did however see somewhat of an
impact on criminal activity in both Wellington and Christchurch over the lockdowns.
